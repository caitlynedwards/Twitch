# twitch
This Github folder contains code used in two projects:

The first has been published here:
Edwards, C., Pollack, C., Pritschet, S., Haushalter, K., Long, J., & Masterson, T. (2022). 
Prevalence and comparisons of alcohol, candy, energy drink, snack, soda, and restaurant brand and product marketing on Twitch, 
Facebook Gaming and YouTube Gaming. 
Public Health Nutrition, 25(1), 1-12. doi:10.1017/S1368980021004420

The second is under review.

Here is how to utilize this code:
1) All codes reference the "MispellingsList.py" or "MispellingsList_Original.py". Here is where you can pull in the code words you would like to scrape from either the titles or the chat.
2) For the 2022 publication you can use the files "JustNumbers.py", "TitleScraping2020.py", "TitleScraping2020JustNumbers.py", "TitleScraping2020JustNumbers_AllMonths.py"
2) For chat scraping you can use the "ChatScraping2020_Annotated_Final.py" file.
